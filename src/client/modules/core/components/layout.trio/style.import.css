/*
1. Avoid the IE 10-11 `min-height` bug.
2. Set `flex-shrink` to `0` to prevent some browsers from
    letting these items shrink to smaller than their content's
    default minimum size. See http://bit.ly/1Mn35US for details.
 3. If possible, use '100%'. '100vh' is buggy in older mobile
    Safari. But I couldn't make '100%' work properly.
 4. WARNING: Don't put flex-grow on header and footer
